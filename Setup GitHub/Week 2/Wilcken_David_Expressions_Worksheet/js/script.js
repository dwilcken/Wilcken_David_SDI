//Dog years problem
//Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”
//Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.
var humanYears = 2;
var dogYears = 7;
var sparkyAge = humanYears * dogYears;

//multiply sparkysAge by dog years
console.log("Sparky is "+humanYears+" years old in human years which is "+sparkyAge+" years in dog years");
