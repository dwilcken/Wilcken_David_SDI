//Dog years problem
//Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”
//Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.
var humanYears = 2;
var dogYears = 7;
var sparkyAge = humanYears * dogYears;

//multiply sparkysAge by dog years
console.log("Sparky is "+humanYears+" years old in human years which is "+sparkyAge+" years in dog years");

//Slice of pie part 1
//A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an expression that calculates
//how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party.  (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices
//and that the person dividing the pizza is really precise, so this can be a decimal, like 3.52 slices, etc.)
var slices = 8;
var people = 35;
var pizzas = 7;
var slicesPerPerson = slices * pizzas / people;

console.log("Each person ate "+slicesPerPerson+" slices of pizza at the party");
