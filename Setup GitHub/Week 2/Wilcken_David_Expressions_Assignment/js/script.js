//Density Altitude Calculator
//Density altitude = pressure altitude +(120 x (OAT - ISA temp))
//Oat = Outside air temp
//ISA = Standard temp which is found by - 2 degrees celsius per 1000ft of altitude
//Pressure altitude is measured in inches of mercury.

var pressureAltitude = "Station Altimeter Setting";
var currentTemperature = "Outside Air Temperature";
var stationElevation = "Station Elevation AGL";
